# Instructions 

In this directory (and in every "tutorial" directory), there will be a bunch of files floating around. Some of these are files YOU need to complete the tutorial (these will be in a demarcated directory), and some are files associated with okpy that you don't have to worry about. 

To complete any homework assignment, follow the following prescription: 
```
source activate pydecal #on windows, just 'activate pydecal' (see instructions online for setting up python env)
jupyter notebook hw__.ipynb 
```
The notebook should then open in a web browser. Follow the instructions in the notebook, and submit at the end of the file. Then 
```
source deactivate #on windows, just 'deactivate'
```
